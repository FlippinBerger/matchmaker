Welcome to my matchmaker exploration where I will be trying to come up with different ways to match up players in a 5v5 game via different algorithms.

The first algo is a dumb "fastest" match where the matchmaker simply takes each player as they come in and put them into the currently being built game.
Obviously this is bad if the players have big skill gaps as seen in their MMRs but will keep queue times as low as they can possibly be, and was an easy place to start.

You can run the default case by simply having Rust installed and typing:
`cargo run` in the root of the repo
